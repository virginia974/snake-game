Basic snake game where the player controls the snake's movements using the arrow keys. Apples randomly appear for the snake to eat, and with each apple it eats, the snake grows. The snake must eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body.

This snake game was created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.
